## Description
This application allows a user to track their daily workouts. They can log multiple exercises on a specific day, track the name, type, sets, reps, and duration of exercise, and track distance traveled if they did a cardio workout.

## Work Involved
For this application, I developed the html routes in order to render the different html pages. I created a workout model in order to store the exercise information within the database. I also constructed the api routes to allow for functionality within the site.
